# Laravel with Vue.js Version 2

Trying to figure out what's going on there. I created this project using ChatGPT, and they gave me random of packages to install. But it was failed everytime. I learned CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) from YouTube source, and I learned RESTFul API by myself.

* **Failed Attempt 1**: **Aug 27, 2024**. Can't log in. Using authorization token.
* Success Attempt 1: **Aug 27, 2024**. Finally logged in using authorization token, and successfully logout.
* **Failed Attempt 2**: **Aug 28, 2024**. Can't fetch the data from the user id. I created an API endpoint `/user/{id}`. From here I can't fetch the data.
* Success Attempt 2: **Aug 28, 2024**. Finally, it worked. I didn't know how. But it worked.
* **Failed Attempt 3**: **Aug 28, 2024**. Now I want to change navbar component and footer component. I mean when user logged into their account navbar and footer will be showed their info. From ChatGPT, I installed random of packages, like vuex. But I still figured out what's going on.
